This project was an assignment from my mentor, Christen Xie.

The purpose: to develop experience in one of the leading front-end technologies today, React.

The assignment: to build a to-do list in React. To-do list should have the following capabilities: add a task, delete a task, mark a task as completed, and mark a task as uncompleted.
